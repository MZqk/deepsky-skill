| Restores an image using the Richardson-Lucy method.
| 
| Optionally, a PSF may be loaded using the argument **-loadpsf=\ filename** (created with MAKEPSF).
| 
| The number of iterations is provide by **-iters** (the default is 10).
| 
| The type of regularization can be set with **-tv** for Total Variation, or **-fh** for the Frobenius norm of the Hessian matrix (the default is none) and **-alpha=** provides the regularization strength (lower value = more regularization, default = 3000).
| 
| By default the gradient descent method is used with a default step size of 0.0005, however the multiplicative method may be specified with **-mul**.
| 
| The stopping criterion may be activated by specifying a stopping limit with **-stop=**

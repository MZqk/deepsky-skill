| Generalised hyperbolic stretch based on the work of the ghsastro.co.uk team.
| 
| The argument **-D=** defines the strength of the stretch, between 0 and 10. This is the only mandatory argument. The following optional arguments further tailor the stretch:
| **B** defines the intensity of the stretch near the focal point, between -5 and 15;
| **LP** defines a shadow preserving range between 0 and SP where the stretch will be linear, preserving shadow detail;
| **SP** defines the symmetry point of the stretch, between 0 and 1, which is the point at which the stretch will be most intense;
| **HP** defines a region between HP and 1 where the stretch is linear, preserving highlight details and preventing star bloat.
| If omitted B, LP and SP default to 0.0 ad HP defaults to 1.0.
| An optional argument (either **-human**, **-even** or **-independent**) can be passed to select either human-weighted or even-weighted luminance or independent colour channels for colour stretches. The argument is ignored for mono images. Alternatively, the argument **-sat** specifies that the stretch is performed on image saturation - the image must be color and all channels must be selected for this to work.
| Optionally the parameter **[channels]** may be used to specify the channels to apply the stretch to: this may be R, G, B, RG, RB or GB. The default is all channels. The clip mode can be set using the argument **-clipmode=**: values **clip**, **rescale**, **rgbblend** or **globalrescale** are accepted and the default is rgbblend

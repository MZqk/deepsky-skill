| Generates an intensity profile plot between 2 points in the image, also known as a *cut*. The arguments may be provided in any order. The arguments **-to=x,y** and **-from=x,y** are mandatory.
| 
| The argument **-layer=\ {red \| green \| blue \| lum \| col}** specifies which channel (or luminance or colour) to plot if the image is color. It may also be used with the **-tri** option, which generates 3 parallel equispaced profiles each separated by **-spacing=** pixels, but note that for tri profiles the **col** option will be treated the same as **lum**.
| 
| The option **-cfa** selects CFA mode, which generates 4 profiles: 1 for each CFA channel in a Bayer patterned image. This option cannot be used with color images or mono images with no Bayer pattern, and cannot be used at the same time as the **-tri** option.
| 
| The option **-arcsec** causes the x axis to display distance in arcsec, if the necessary metadata is available. If not provided or if metadata is not available, distance will be shown in pixel units.
| 
| The argument **-savedat** will cause the data files to be saved: the filename will be written to the log. Alternatively the argument **-filename=** can be used to specify a filename to write the data file to. (The **-filename=** option implies **-savedat**.)
| 
| The argument **"-title=\ My Title"** sets a custom title "My Title"
